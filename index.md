# Welcome!
I am a PhD student in Computer Science (AI/NLP) at Colorado State University, working with [Dr. Nikhil Krishnaswamy](https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/). 
 
What happens when AI begins to truly understand and align with human intentions? That's the question I aim to answer. I specialize in developing next-generation generative AI systems that are not only intelligent but also deeply aligned with human values. My work spans aligning summaries of doctor-patient interactions to designing AI "thought-partners" for enhanced collaboration, with a focus on safety, alignment, and usability. By combining rigorous alignment methodologies with an emphasis on human-centric design, I strive to create systems that are efficient, trustworthy, and accessible.
